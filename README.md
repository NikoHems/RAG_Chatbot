# Proposal: RAG Chatbot for Case Study Training

This proposal outlines the plan to create a **RAG Chatbot** for interactive case study discussions. Using open-source frameworks like [Verba](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba) and open-source language models (hosted through platforms such as Ollama), the chatbot will enable candidates to simulate and practice case interviews effectively.

---

## Objective

The chatbot will:
- Allow candidates to **upload case studies** and practice solving them interactively.
- Simulate the dynamics of consulting interviews, helping users structure their thoughts and improve their problem-solving skills.
- Provide actionable feedback for refining communication and analytical approaches.

## Approach

1. **Core Technologies**:
   - **Verba**: Leverage Verba to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow that ensures accurate and contextually relevant responses during case discussions.
   - **Open-Source Models**: Use open-source large language models hosted on platforms like Ollama for generating responses.

2. **Interactive Case Discussions**:
   - The chatbot will analyze the uploaded case study and act as an interviewer.
   - It will guide the candidate through the process, prompting them to ask clarifying questions, structure hypotheses, and explore solutions.

3. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - After the discussion, the chatbot will generate detailed feedback, highlighting:
     - Logical structuring of answers.
     - Depth of analysis and clarity in communication.
     - Overall problem-solving performance.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Custom Case Study Upload**: Users can upload their own case studies to practice with tailored scenarios.
- **Adaptive Interactions**: The chatbot adjusts its responses and questions based on the candidate’s inputs, simulating real interview dynamics.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: By using open-source models, the chatbot remains flexible and cost-efficient while being accessible across various platforms.

---

## Benefits

- **Realistic Interview Simulation**: Helps candidates build confidence and refine their skills in a controlled, low-pressure environment.
- **Cost-Effective Solution**: Open-source tools reduce dependency on expensive APIs.
- **Personalized Practice**: Candidates can focus on specific industries or types of cases.

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Feasibility**: Evaluate Verba’s integration capabilities for case study ingestion and retrieval.
2. **System Design**: Develop a high-level architecture for the chatbot, detailing the interaction flow.
3. **Prototype Development**: Build and test a minimum viable product using sample case studies.
